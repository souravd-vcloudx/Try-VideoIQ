# Real time video communication application (One to One) using VideoIQ platform (Only Client End Application)

User application requires `two` components to initiate and perform real-time communications hosted on `VideoIQ platform`.
- An `Application Server` running as a Web Service which uses VideoIQ Video Server API to create token for hosted RTC Applications.
- `Client Application` running on Client End Points (Web browser, native clients like Android & iOS etc.) which uses VideoIQ Client Toolkits / SDKs to establish a RTC session with VideoIQ Platform.

This github sample project will enable you to create a `Client Application` for a very simple real time video communication application using VideoIQ Web SDK.
